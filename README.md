# React Mini-App Assessment (Dashboard + Hooks)

Goal: Build a tiny React app that lists items (e.g., “Projects” or “Tasks”), supports a search filter, shows an item details view via routing, and uses one custom hook for data access (mocked locally). Keep it simple but idiomatic.

## Tech Stack

- React (v19)
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM
- Lucide React Icons
- Vitest & React Testing Library
- ESLint & Prettier

## Core expectations

- Modern React (v18+), Vite.
- Functional components + hooks.
- One custom hook (e.g., useProjects()).
- Basic routing for list → details.
- A controlled form input for filtering.
- A11y: at least one aria-\* attribute.
- A minimal test.
- Readme with run instructions.
